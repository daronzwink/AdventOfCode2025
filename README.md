# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

## About

Advent of Code 2025 features 12 days of programming challenges. This year, I plan to approach this with assistance from Claude Code and other AI-assistance tools as needed.

## Setup

This project uses Python 3.13 and pipenv for dependency management.

### Installation

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

## Structure

Each day's challenge is contained in its own directory (`day01/`, `day02/`, etc.) with the following files:

- `dayXX.py` - Solution code
- `dayXX.dat` - Puzzle input
- `dayXX_example_part1.dat` - Example input for part 1
- `dayXX_example_part2.dat` - Example input for part 2

## Progress
